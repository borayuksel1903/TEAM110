## Pointers with Git:

1) When making changes, create and switch to new branch with name relating to the change 
```
git checkout -b <branch_name> 
```
2) Finish your changes, and add and commit the file.
3) Then git push the new branch to github 
```
git push -u origin <branch_name>
```
4) Then review the new branch, submit a pull request and compare new branch with master, and approve it if no conflicts.
5) Then other members can git pull the changes.
 
This way a working model will be preserved in master.
