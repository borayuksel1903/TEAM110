## Merging a Branche to master: (Bora)
1) On GitHub, click on the brnach, <branch_name>, and it should prompt for a pull request. 
2) Review the new branch and compare <branch_name> with master, and approve it if there are no conflicts.
 
This way a working model will always be preserved in master.
