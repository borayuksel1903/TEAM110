If you are on a Mac AND ONLY IF chromedriver.mac EXISTS!!! 
- Change chromedriver to chromedriver.linux
- Change chromedriver.mac to chromedriver

If on Windows, use chromedriver.exe

To locally run, run it with 
$ python server.py

Unless someone comes up with something better! Any questions let me know
