If you are on a Mac AND ONLY IF chromedriver.mac EXISTS!!! 
- Change chromedriver to chromedriver.linux
- Change chromedriver.mac to chromedriver

If on Windows, use chromedriver.exe

To locally run, run it with 
$ python server.py

Unless someone comes up with something better! Any questions let me know.


Changes:
Nicole's backend code --> client.py
Mihai's script --> getMPG.py
Gavin's script --> getPrices.py
Gavin/Ralph/Mihai's backend --> server.py (main server that ONLY runs flask)
